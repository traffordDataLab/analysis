## Re-aggregating 2015 Indices of Deprivation to 2019 Local Authority district boundaries

#### Method for calculating average scores

1. Multiply each LSOA score by the appropriate population denominator for each domain or sub-domain    

|Domain |Population Denominator |
|:--- |:---- |
|IMD |total population |
|Income |total population |
|Employment |working age |
|Education, Skills & Training |total population |
|Health |total population |
|Crime |total population |
|Housing |total population |
|Living Environment |total population |
|Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index(IDOACI) |dependent children |
|Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDOPCI) |older population |

2\. Sum scores by 2019 local authority district    
3\. Sum LSOA population by local authority district     
4\. Divide total score by appropriate local authority district population   
5\. Rank in ascending order
