This report explores the [2019 English Indices of Deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) for Trafford. It compares Trafford with other local authorities in Greater Manchester using the rank of average score, tracks relative change in ranking between 2015 and 2019, indicates the percentage of LSOAs in the most deprived decile, and identifies the most deprived small areas.

## Key findings

- Trafford is ranked 191 on the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) out of 317 local authority districts in England where 1 is the most deprived and 317 is the least deprived. Trafford ranked 199 in 2015.
- The increase in relative deprivation in Trafford between 2015 and 2019 is consistent with other Greater Manchester local authorities with the exception of Manchester.
- The proportion of Trafford's Lower-layer Super Output areas in the most deprived 10% nationally was 5.1% on the 2019 IMD. This represents an increase of 2.2% since the 2015 IMD. All other local authorities in Greater Manchester reported relative increases with the exception of Bury which remained unchanged between IoD releases.
- Trafford was ranked the least deprived of all Greater Manchester local authorities across the 2019 IoD Income, Employment, Education, Health, and Crime domains and the Income Deprivation Affecting Children sub-domain.
- Trafford was the 7th most deprived local authority on the 2019 IoD Housing and Living Environment domains and 9th on the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People sub-domain.
- Trafford 017E in Bucklow-St Martins ward is the most deprived LSOA in Trafford ranking 490 out of 32,844 LSOAs in England. It sits within the 5% most deprived LSOAs nationally for Income, Employment, Education, Health and Income Deprivation Affecting Children.
- In Trafford 017E in Bucklow-St Martins ward, 44.1% of children aged 0 to 15 live in income deprived families.
- Trafford 001A in Clifford ward ranks 572 out of 32,844 LSOAs nationally on the Employment domain with 28.9% of working-age residents involuntarily excluded from the labour market.
- Trafford 001D in Clifford ward ranks 298 out of 32,844 LSOAs nationally on the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People sub-domain with 56.8% of all those aged 60 or over experiencing income deprivation.

## Background

The [English Indices of Deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) were published by the [Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) in September 2019. The Indices measure relative levels of deprivation in 32,844 Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England. Each LSOA contains approximately 1,500 residents or 650 households. They are ranked from 1 (most deprived) to 32,844 (least deprived) and assigned to a decile ranging from 1 (most deprived 10%) to 10 (least deprived 10%). Local authorities in England are also ranked from 1 to 317 based on a population weighted average rank or score of the LSOA data.

Relative deprivation is measured using 39 indicators which are grouped across seven different domains:

* **Income** - the proportion of the population experiencing deprivation relating to low income, including those people-out-of-work, and those who have low earnings    
* **Employment** - the proportion of the working age population in an area involuntarily excluded from the labour market     
* **Education, Skills and Training** - the lack of attainment and skills in the local population   
* **Health and Disability** - the risk of premature death and the impairment of quality of life through poor physical or mental health     
* **Crime** - the risk of personal and material victimisation at a local level  
* **Barriers to Housing and Services** - the physical and financial accessibility of housing and local services     
* **Living Environment** - the quality of the local environment    

Each domain is combined and weighted to create the **Index of Multiple Deprivation** (IMD), an overall measure of relative deprivation. 

A further 2 supplementary indices of income deprivation are also provided:    

* **Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index** - the proportion of all children aged 0 to 15 living in income deprived families          
* **Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index** - the proportion of all those aged 60 or over who experience income deprivation   

#### Please note      
- The Indices of Deprivation measure *relative* deprivation so a change in rank between 2019 and 2015 releases does not necessarily indicate a change in *absolute* levels of deprivation.     
- Local authority summaries for 2015 have been reaggregated to 2019 Local Authority District boundaries to enable direct comparisons to be made. The methodology followed is available in Appendix A of the IoD2019 [research report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833947/IoD2019_Research_Report.pdf).

#### Further resources
- Ward level summaries of the 2019 Indices of Deprivation for Trafford are available to view interactively in linked charts and maps [here](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/ward_profiler/).
- A web application which interactively visualises the proportion of LSOAs in the most deprived decile and the spatial distribution of relative deprivation for every local authority district in England is available [here](https://trafforddatalab.shinyapps.io/imd19).

## Index of Multiple Deprivation
Trafford is ranked 191 out of 317 local authority districts in England on the average 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score, where a rank of 1 is the most deprived. Trafford's relative position has fallen from 199 in 2015. This reflects a general trend in relative deprivation rankings across Greater Manchester where all but 1 local authority districts reported a fall in rank since 2015. However, Trafford remains the least deprived local authority in Greater Manchester.

The proportion of Trafford's LSOAs ranked in the 1st decile or 10% most deprived in England was 5.1% (7 out of 138) in 2019. This represents a relative increase on 2015 when 2.9% (4 out of 138) of LSOAs were ranked within the 1st decile. However, the proportion of LSOAs in Trafford in the bottom decile is much lower than other Greater Manchester local authorities.
