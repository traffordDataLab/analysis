Statistics about reported road traffic casualties in the Greater Manchester area updated annually. For most tabulations data is provided for each year from either 1989 to 2015 or from 1994 to 2015. If data is required for other years, please contact HFAS. 

By providing the data in this single year format, the user is able to undertake their own analysis on trends more easily. 

The tables are based on data collected by the Greater Manchester Police about road traffic accidents that involved personal injury and took place on the public highway. Deaths or injuries occurring on the public highway without a vehicle being involved are not classed as road traffic accidents. Accidents that do not become known to the police, or only become known 30 days or longer after their occurrence are also excluded. Accidents are recorded by the police using the STATS19 form, a copy of which can be found in HFAS Report 1800, available at www.gmtu.gov.uk. 

The number of injury accidents not known to the Greater Manchester Police is not easily identified. It would seem reasonable to assume that all `fatal’ accidents are reported, but these represent only a small proportion of the total. However, the limited evidence available indicates that serious’ andslight’ accidents are under reported. Without a detailed study in Greater Manchester, it has been assumed historically that 20% and 35% respectively have not been reported. It has also been assumed that the level of under-reporting has been consistent from year to year when analysing the statistics presented in this report. For further information on the levels of reporting in road accidents, the DfT have produced a number of papers which are available via their website www.dft.gov.uk.

Copies of the order are served on the owners of land upon which the trees are growing, and on the owner occupiers of affected and joining properties.

Once an order has been made, the consent of the council is required before a tree may be pruned or felled. In certain circumstances, it may be agreed that pruning or removal may be permitted in order to accommodate development, but the TPO enables the council to control these actions and to obtain new planting to replace trees which are removed. You can download a form to get approval to carry out pruning or felling work to trees protected by a TPO. There is no fee involved.

If a tree is cut down, uprooted or wilfully destroyed or is deliberately damaged, or pruned in a manner likely to destroy it, in contravention of a TPO, the responsible person may be prosecuted and liable to pay a substantial fine.

Super Output Areas (SOAs) form a geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics in England and Wales. Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are built from 
groups of 2011 Census Output Areas (OAs), typically 4 to 6, and designed to have a population of between 1,000 and 3,000 persons. These LSOAs nest within Middle Layer Super 
Output Areas (MSOAs), there are typically 4 to 5 LSOAs within a MSOA.

There are 34,753 LSOAs in England and Wales (32,844 in England, 1,909 in Wales) and they were generated by a computer programme which merged OAs taking into account measures of 
population size, mutual proximity and social homogeneity. These boundaries have been revised following the results of the 2011 Census and were released to the public in October 2012.

Notes and Definitions
1. These figures are consistent with the published mid-2013 local authority population estimates (MYE7PE2). Please note that MYE7PE2 includes an error in the distribution of the foreign 
    armed forces (FAF) special population that impacts on the estimates for a number of local authorities, most notably Forest Heath. Small areas within the affected local authorities, included 
    in this release, will also reflect this error. Further details are available in the 
2. The Small Area Population Estimates (including estimates for LSOAs, MSOAs, Wards, Parliamentary Constituencies, PCOs, CCGs and National Parks) were initially intended for publication 
    by five year age group and sex.  The more detailed estimates provided here are intended to enable and encourage further analysis and use of the estimates. Particular caution should be 
    exercised in using estimates at a greater level of disaggregation - for example, for Output Areas, or for single year of age groups, as these would not be expected to have the same level of 
    accuracy as the aggregated estimates.
3. The estimated resident population of an area includes all those people who usually live there, regardless of nationality.  Arriving international migrants are included in the usually resident 
    population if they remain in the UK for at least a year.   Emigrants are excluded if they remain outside the UK for at least a year.   This is consistent with the United Nations definition of a 
    long-term migrant.  Armed forces stationed outside of the UK are excluded.  Students are taken to be usually resident at their term time address.
4. These estimates are subject to statistical disclosure control. The general application of statistical disclosure control ensures that information attributable to an individual or organisation is not 
    disclosed in any publication.
5. Note that age 90 comprises data for ages 90 and above.
