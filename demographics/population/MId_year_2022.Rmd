<p>From the Census 2021 to Mid-Year 2022 the population has grow 0.53%, this is 1% less than GM at 1.53% grow and 0.56% less than England at 1.09%.</p>

<p>From Mid-Year 2021 to Mid-Year 2022 the population has grow 0.3%, this is 1.16% less than GM at 1.47% grow and 0.67% less than England at 0.97%. Trafford has the lowest growth compared to the rest of GM authorities.</p>

<p>The median age in Trafford was 41 years, 0.2 years more than the median age in Mid-Year 2021. Trafford had the third highest median age among GM authorities. GM median age is 37.3 years and Englandâ€™s median age is 40.5 years.</p>

<p>From Mid-Year 2021 to Mid-Year 2022 there was an estimate of 2,274 births and 2,103 deaths, with a surplus of births over deaths of 171. The Internal Migration inflow was 13,629 and the Internal Migration outflow was 14,870, with a net Internal Migration of -1,241. The International Migration inflow was 3,048 and the International Migration outflow was 1,261, with a net international migration of 1,787. Other changes account for -2.</p>

<p>Internal migration outflow is larger than the internal migration inflow for Trafford, England and the rest of the GM authorities except for Salford and Wigan which had a large internal migration inflow. Net International migration is the largest component of population growth for Trafford and all GM authorities, and England.</p>

<p>Births minus deaths or natural change has decline over the years. Net Internal Migration have gone from adding over 1,000 residents in 2013 to deducting residents from 2019, reaching -1,241 in 2022. Net International Migration has notably increased particularly in 2022 after negative numbers in 2019 and 2020.</p>
